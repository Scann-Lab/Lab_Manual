# Lab_Manual
The SCANN lab manual, including all lab policies.

This is the home of the living SCANN lab manual. 

If you're just joining the lab, your *first* job is to read through this manual, completing all tasks in the Orientation section. 

First, download the PDF of the lab manual and read it through. Once you've read through, email a copy of the signed and dated checklist to <stevenweisberg@ufl.edu>. 

To make edits, the lab manual is written in R Markdown.
